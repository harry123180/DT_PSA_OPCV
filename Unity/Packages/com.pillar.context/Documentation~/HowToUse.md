## Authoring in the Inspector

The `ContextNode` inspector shows five things:

1. **A derived-information panel** — the resolved topology path and the GameObject's other components
   (filtered so `Transform`, `Collider`, `Renderer` and `MeshFilter` noise does not drown out the
   meaningful ones). Only what the node genuinely does not store: framework metadata is not repeated
   here, because it is in the entry list itself.
2. **The entry list** — Unity's own reorderable list, so drag-to-reorder, add and remove behave as you
   expect. An authored row is a single-line key over a word-wrapping, scrolling value field, since
   good context is usually a sentence or two rather than a word. A **synced row is one compact
   disabled line**: its value is a short machine string, and editing it would only survive until the
   next sync reverted it.
3. **A Sync Framework Metadata button**, shown only when something is installed to sync from.
4. **The Topology foldout** — the two optional overrides, `Segment` and `Parent`, collapsed by default
   because the common case leaves both empty. See [Topology](#topologypath--the-tree-you-author).
5. **Warnings** — duplicate keys, empty keys, and a topology segment containing `/` surface as warnings
   rather than being blocked, which matches the API's own tolerance and keeps you from losing
   half-typed work.

The component filter is shared with the exporter, so the component list you see while writing context
is exactly the one that gets exported.

### What to write

Keys are free-form; consistency across a project matters more than any particular vocabulary. Ones
that earn their place in practice: `Function` (what this does in the process), `Purpose` (why it
exists), `Interlocks` (what must be true before it may act), `Operator` (what a human does here),
`Failure` (what going wrong looks like).

Write what the scene cannot already tell a reader. "A conveyor motor" is visible from the components;
"runs continuously while the upstream buffer holds at least one part" is not.

## Export

**PILLAR ▸ Context ▸ Export Machine Context (JSON)** walks the transform hierarchy and writes
`Assets/StreamingAssets/{SceneName}_Context.json`.

**Choosing the root.** An explicit selection wins. With nothing selected the exporter looks for a root
GameObject named `Project` (the Open Commissioning convention), then falls back to the scene's only
root. If the scene has several roots and none is named `Project`, it reports the roots and asks you to
select one rather than guessing. It logs instead of opening a dialog, because the menu item is also
driven headlessly through the Unity CLI, where a modal would block the caller.

**Pruning.** A subtree is kept when it contains an authored `ContextNode` anywhere within it, or when
an installed integration vouches for it — under Open Commissioning, when it contains any OC component
or `Hierarchy`. Everything else is dropped. This matters more than it sounds: the raw hierarchy of a
real machine is overwhelmingly CAD mesh geometry — around 7,300 GameObjects in the reference project
`Demo_1` — and an unpruned export is almost entirely noise.

Note the asymmetry: pruning applies to *children*. The root you export is always emitted, even if it
is empty.

**Disabled objects are skipped**, along with everything under them — the export states what the machine
is right now. This is not cosmetic: a scene that keeps two variants of a station side by side, one of
them switched off, gives both the same name in the same place, so exporting both produces two nodes
that are indistinguishable by `scenePath` and a consumer keyed by path silently reads one of them.
A subtree whose only content is disabled is dropped with it.

The root you select is exempt here too, so exporting a switched-off station on purpose still works:
select it and its enabled contents are written.

**Walking transforms, not the framework's flat grouping.** The export follows Unity transform parenting
rather than Open Commissioning's flat `Link.ScenePath`, which would flatten past the structural station
and assembly wrappers that carry a `Hierarchy` but no `IDevice` — exactly the nodes where a human
writes the most useful context.

## The JSON schema

```json
{
  "sceneName": "Demo_1",
  "generatedAtUtc": "2026-08-08T09:12:44.1234567Z",
  "root": { "...": "ContextExportNode" }
}
```

Each node:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | GameObject name |
| `scenePath` | Slash path through the Unity scene from the export root, e.g. `Project/Geometry/FG_01/P_Reader` |
| `topologyPath` | Slash path through the `ContextNode` tree, e.g. `Project/FG_01/P_Reader`. `""` for a node-less object |
| `components` | Filtered component type names |
| `entries` | The node's whole dictionary, in stored order: authored context and synced framework metadata alike |
| `children` | Nested nodes, in sibling order |

A node is two computed paths and **one dictionary**. The export writes down what the `ContextNode`
holds rather than assembling a view of it — nothing is queried at export time, which is why the
result is identical on a machine with no twin framework installed.

The document is written by the exporter rather than by `JsonUtility`, whose serializer stops at ten
levels of nesting and drops the rest with nothing but a console warning. Each exported level costs two
of those ten — the node, then its children list — so a real hierarchy went short at around the fifth.
**Depth is now bounded by the scene alone.** Note that `JsonUtility.FromJson` has the same limit on the
way back in, so read the file with a real JSON parser, not with Unity's.

```json
{
  "name": "P_Reader",
  "scenePath": "Project/Geometry/FG_01/P_Reader",
  "topologyPath": "Project/FG_01/P_Reader",
  "components": ["Sensor"],
  "entries": [
    { "key": "Function",      "value": "Reads the DMC on the carrier." },
    { "key": "oc.plcPath",    "value": "MAIN.FG_01.P_Reader" },
    { "key": "oc.deviceType", "value": "SensorBinary" }
  ],
  "children": []
}
```

### One list, two kinds of entry

A key with no namespace is a human's. A key prefixed with an installed integration's namespace —
`oc.` for Open Commissioning — was written by [a sync](#syncing-framework-metadata) and is owned by
that integration.

The prefix is the whole ownership mechanism: it is what lets a sync overwrite `oc.plcPath` without
ever reading your `Function`, and what lets it delete an entry whose underlying fact is gone. Two
consequences worth knowing:

- **Never hand-write a prefixed key.** `context_set` and `context_remove` refuse them outright, and
  the Inspector draws them as disabled rows, because the next sync would revert the edit anyway.
- **`Motor.Speed` is yours.** A dot alone means nothing; only a prefix matching an *installed*
  provider does. Your own dotted keys count as coverage and are never touched.

### Syncing framework metadata

Nothing writes to your scene unless you ask. Run **PILLAR ▸ Context ▸ Sync Framework Metadata**, press
*Sync Framework Metadata* on a node's Inspector, or use the CLI:

```bash
unity command context_sync --dry_run true    # the drift report - reads only
unity command context_sync --dry_run false   # write it
```

For each node, sync reconciles rather than rewrites: a key whose value is unchanged is left alone, a
changed one is updated **in place** so entry order and the scene diff stay stable, a new one is
appended, and one the provider no longer answers for is removed.

**The dry run is the only staleness detection in the package.** Persisted data drifts — rename an
object, delete a `Hierarchy` component, and the stored value is wrong until you sync again. Nothing
polls for that on your behalf, so run the dry run before you trust an export.

**Entries from an integration you have since uninstalled are left alone.** They are orphans: not
recognised, not rewritten, not deleted. Opening the project without Open Commissioning must not strip
the OC data out of every scene — but it also means nothing can clean those entries up automatically.

### `topologyPath` — the tree you author

The topology is the logical machine structure, and it is exactly the `ContextNode` tree: a node hangs
under the nearest ancestor that also carries a node, and objects without a node are not in it at all.
A CAD wrapper you never annotated therefore appears in `scenePath` and vanishes from `topologyPath`.

Two optional overrides on `ContextNode` shape it, both in the inspector's **Topology** foldout:

- **Segment** — the name this node contributes. Empty means the GameObject's name.
- **Parent** — the node it hangs under. Empty means the nearest ancestor carrying a node. Setting it
  lets the topology diverge from transform parenting entirely, which is the point: transform parenting
  is arranged for the scene, and the machine's structure often is not the same shape.

A segment containing `/` is flagged in the inspector — it would make the path unsplittable downstream.
A `Parent` chain that loops back on itself is truncated with a console warning rather than hanging.

### Framework keys — an open vocabulary

Keys are chosen by whichever integration is installed; nothing in the package interprets them. An
absent key means the framework did not state that fact, which is not the same as stating it false.

Open Commissioning claims the `oc` namespace and writes:

| Key | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `oc.plcPath` | `MAIN.FG_01.P_Reader` | Position in the PLC symbol tree |
| `oc.hierarchyRole` | `group` | A `Hierarchy` that opens a level in that path, joined with `.` |
| `oc.hierarchyRole` | `sampler` | A `Hierarchy` with `IsNameSampler`: opens no level, prefixes its children's names with `_` instead, so a group like `FG_Transport` stays flat |
| `oc.deviceType` | `SensorBinary` | The `IDevice` component's type. Present on devices only |
| `oc.aggregatedBy` | a panel's name | A `PanelSampler` folded this device into its own single symbol |
| `oc.simulationDevice` | `true` | The device exchanges no data with the controller and no sampler accounts for that |

**A node is a real PLC symbol when it has an `oc.deviceType` and neither of the last two keys.** Every
Transform resolves an `oc.plcPath`, including pure structure, so `oc.deviceType` is what separates a
device from a wrapper in the JSON export, which carries no tier field.

`oc.aggregatedBy` and `oc.simulationDevice` are **inferred**, not read: OC has no simulation flag, and
`Link.Enable == false` carries both meanings at once. Separating them is what makes either claim
truthful — a `PanelSampler` force-disables its members' links at `Start`, so without the split every
panel member would read as simulation-only. Code generation must skip both.

## CLI commands

`Editor/Pipeline/` registers `[CliCommand]` tools so the annotated hierarchy can be read and written
from a terminal against a live Editor, via the Unity CLI and `com.unity.pipeline`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `context_tree` | List targets (nested or flat) with tier, both paths, components, node state |
| `context_get` | Read one target's whole entry dictionary |
| `context_set` | Upsert entries — a single `key`/`value`, or an `entries` JSON array |
| `context_remove` | Remove one entry by key |
| `context_ensure` | Add empty `ContextNode`s in bulk (dry-run by default) |
| `context_sync` | Write framework metadata into the nodes, or report drift (dry-run by default) |
| `context_audit` | Coverage per tier, plus lists of missing and empty nodes |

`context_tree` reports `entryCount` and `entryKeys` for the **authored** entries and `derivedCount`
for the synced ones. Coverage means what a human wrote, so a fully synced but undocumented scene
still reports zero — see the audit note below.

**Addressing.** Targets are named, in this order, by `scenePath`
(`Project/FG_01/Barcode Reader/P_Reader`), by `topologyPath`, by any metadata value that is unique
under the root (case-insensitive — this is what keeps an OC `plcPath` like `MAIN.FG_01.P_Reader`
working as a handle), or by a bare GameObject name when that name is unique. An ambiguous value or
name is an error that tells you the full path to use instead.

**Disabled objects.** Every walk — `context_tree`, `context_audit`, `context_ensure`, `context_sync` —
skips disabled objects and everything under them, on the same rule as the [export](#export), so
coverage is measured against what the export will actually contain. A station whose only devices are
switched off stops being an `assembly` for the same reason. Addressing is the exception: `context_get`
and `context_set` resolve a disabled object by path or name, because documenting a station that is
currently off is ordinary work. It simply stays out of the listings and the export until it is enabled.

**What `context_audit` does not report.** Coverage only: totals, per-tier counts, and the lists of
missing and empty nodes. It deliberately does not aggregate over framework vocabulary — that would
mean the neutral pipeline hard-coding one framework's key names. Read the nodes' `entries` and group
the prefixed keys yourself.

Coverage counts **authored** entries only. This matters more than it sounds: a sync writes an
`oc.` key into every node, so counting list length would report a scene where nobody has written a
word as fully documented.

**Prefabs.** `context_set` and `context_remove` accept `--prefab true` to write to the backing prefab
asset rather than the scene instance. The backing slot is resolved through
`GetCorrespondingObjectFromSource`, not by matching names down from the instance root — an instance may
rename or reorder its children, and a name-matched path silently fails to resolve inside the asset.

**Upsert semantics.** All mutations go through the public `ContextNode` API, so `context_set` is a true
upsert: keys it does not mention are preserved.

**Tiers.** Targets are classified as `machine` (the export root), `group` (its direct children),
`device` (recognised as a device by an installed integration), and `assembly` (anything else with a
device somewhere below it). Without an integration installed there are no devices, so the tiering
collapses to the structural tiers.

## Agent integration

The package supplies the data model, authoring UI and export pipeline. It does not author content —
that is a job for a human or an agent working with one.

The pattern that works: an agent reads the scene, prefabs and behaviour scripts to establish what it
can derive mechanically, asks the engineer for the business and functional facts that code cannot
supply, then writes entries **live** into the running Editor through `context_set` — no scene file
editing, no reimport, and the result is visible in the Inspector immediately. `context_audit` reports
what is still uncovered, so the work can be resumed across sessions.

`Skills~/` ships three Claude Code skills that implement exactly that loop — inspect, author, audit.

## Supporting another twin framework

The package core knows nothing about Open Commissioning. Everything framework-specific arrives through
one interface:

```csharp
namespace PILLAR.Context.Editor
{
    public interface IContextMetadataProvider
    {
        int Order { get; }
        string Namespace { get; }                 // "oc" -> your keys land as "oc.plcPath"
        bool IsRelevant(Transform subtreeRoot);   // should this subtree survive pruning?
        bool IsDevice(Transform t);               // is this the leaf tier?
        IEnumerable<ContextEntry> ResolveMetadata(Transform t);   // bare keys; the registry prefixes
    }
}
```

Only four questions, and only two of them are structural. Everything else your framework knows leaves
through `ResolveMetadata` as key/value pairs you name yourself — the package neither defines nor
interprets the vocabulary, which is why adding a framework never means editing the schema.

Implement it in an Editor assembly, give the class a public parameterless constructor, and it is picked
up automatically through `TypeCache` — there is no registration call.

**`Namespace` is a permanent commitment.** It is how a sync recognises the entries it owns inside a
node's list, so changing it later strands every entry already written into every scene, with nothing
able to clean them up. A provider whose namespace is blank, contains a `.`, or is already claimed by
another installed provider is refused at discovery with an error rather than half-supported.

Every method receives arbitrary Transforms from anywhere in the scene. Return an empty sequence
(or `false`) rather than throwing when a Transform means nothing to your framework, and omit a key
rather than emitting a blank value for it — the registry drops blanks, because an absent fact and a
blank one are different statements.

Note what you do **not** implement: `topologyPath` is computed by the package from the `ContextNode`
tree, so it works with no provider installed at all — and nothing calls your provider at export time,
only when someone syncs.

`PILLAR.Context.OpenCommissioning` is the reference implementation and worth reading: one small file,
in an assembly guarded by a `com.open-commissioning.core` version define so it vanishes cleanly when OC
is absent.

## Troubleshooting

**The `context_*` commands are missing.** `com.unity.pipeline` is not installed. It is an experimental
Unity package; add `"com.unity.pipeline": "0.4.0-exp.1"` to your manifest. The rest of the package works
without it.

**The export carries no framework metadata.** Either no provider is installed, or the scene was never
synced — the export writes down what the nodes hold and no longer queries providers itself. The menu
item says which: it warns when providers are installed but nothing under the export root carries a
namespaced key. Run **PILLAR ▸ Context ▸ Sync Framework Metadata** and export again. The
`topologyPath` is unaffected either way — it does not come from a provider.

**A synced value is wrong after a rename or a component change.** Persisted data drifts and nothing
polls for it. `unity command context_sync --dry_run true` lists every node that has moved on.

**`topologyPath` is empty, or shorter than expected.** The topology is exactly the `ContextNode` tree,
so an object without a node has no topology path and an un-annotated level between two nodes collapses
away. Run `context_ensure` to add nodes in bulk, or set the **Parent** override where the structure
should not follow transform parenting.

**`CS0246: The type or namespace name 'OC' could not be found`.** The OC integration is compiling
without OC present, which should be impossible — the assembly is guarded. Check that
`PILLAR.Context.OpenCommissioning.asmdef` still carries both its `PILLAR_OC` define constraint and the
matching `versionDefines` entry, and that the entry's `expression` is empty.

**The exporter reports it cannot decide what to export.** The scene has several root GameObjects and
none is named `Project`. Select the root you want and run the menu item again.

**A station that exists in the scene is missing from the export.** It, or something above it, is
disabled — the export skips disabled objects and everything under them. Enable it and export again, or
select it as the export root if you want that branch on its own.

**Duplicate key warnings after a bulk import.** `Add` refuses duplicates, but the serialized list can
still hold them if it was edited outside the API. Use `Set` for upserts, and fix the flagged rows in the
Inspector.
