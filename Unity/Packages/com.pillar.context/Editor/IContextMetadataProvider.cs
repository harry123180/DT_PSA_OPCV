    /// The package itself knows nothing about any specific twin framework: it stores, edits and
    /// exports key/value context, and derives the topology from the <see cref="ContextNode"/>s the
    /// author placed. A provider contributes what is left — which subtrees are semantically
    /// relevant, which objects are devices, and whatever facts the framework knows about an object
    /// that the package cannot compute.
    ///
    /// Those facts travel as free-form key/value metadata under keys the framework itself chooses,
    /// so a framework's vocabulary never has to be spelled into this package or into the export
    /// schema. Nothing outside the provider interprets them.
    ///
    /// They are not read on demand: <see cref="ContextMetadataSync"/> writes them into the node's own
    /// entry list, under this provider's <see cref="Namespace"/>, so the node ends up holding its
    /// whole record and the export is a straight dump of it. A provider is therefore consulted when
    /// someone syncs, not when someone reads.
    ///
    /// Implementations are discovered automatically by <see cref="ContextMetadataRegistry"/> via
    /// <c>TypeCache</c>, so they need no registration call. They must be concrete, non-generic and
    /// expose a public parameterless constructor.
