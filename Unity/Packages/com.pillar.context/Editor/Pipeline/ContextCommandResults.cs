    // through the CLI serializer. Field names and their order are the CLI's wire contract - agents and
    // the shipped skills read these keys by name, so renaming or reordering one is a breaking change.
    // The 1.2 reshape was exactly that: unityPath -> scenePath, plcPath -> topologyPath, and every
    // framework fact folded into each node's one entry list under a provider namespace. The skills
    // ship in the same release, so the docs naming these keys travel with the code emitting them.
    //
    // Where a command has two genuinely different responses (flat vs nested, wrote vs skipped) each
    // gets its own type rather than one union with half the fields left null: the commands already
    // returned different shapes, and modelling that honestly keeps the emitted JSON identical.
